# INVISIBLE ARMOR

Formerly "ShowSkin": http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/invisible-armor/

Minecraft plugin to show your skin proudly to everyone without losing armor benefits

- your armor is taken away and kept in a safe place in the world
- if some damage occurs that armor can mitigate, it is worn briefly and stored again
- damage mitigations are recalculated (HideArmor doesnt, you got full damage as if you were naked)

this plugin is under constant development, see "changelog.txt" file inside source
